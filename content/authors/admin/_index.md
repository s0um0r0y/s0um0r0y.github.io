    summary: |
      Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me

I am a Research Assistant at IIIT Hyderabad, where I specialize in developing path planning algorithms for autonomous robots using learning based approach under Dr Madhava Krishna. With a Bachelor's degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering from VIT Vellore, my academic journey has been driven by a passion for robotics and intelligent systems.

My research interests lie at the intersection of robotics and machine learning, focusing on creating intelligent systems capable of real-world applications. At IIIT Hyderabad, I have been involved in projects that integrate perception, planning, and control to enhance the autonomy of robotic platforms. I previosly worked under Dr Tushar Sandhan at IIT Kanpur where I worked on human robot collaboration under the SURGE internship program.
