      text: |-
        At IIIT Hyderabad, my research focuses on integrating deep learning algorithms with robotic platforms to enhance autonomy and decision-making capabilities. I have been involved in projects that encompass sensor integration of 3D Lidar and depth camera, real-time data processing, and the development of control strategies for autonomous navigation.

        My technical proficiency includes programming languages such as Python and C++, and I am adept at using tools like ROS (Robot Operating System) and OpenCV for developing and simulating robotic applications. I am passionate about advancing the field of robotics through innovative research.
